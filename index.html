            <img src="assets/images/profilepiccrop.jpg" alt="A photo of me!" height="200" width="200">
            <p>Hi, I'm Sam! I'm a former sales development specialist based in Austin, TX
                 who felt I had more to offer an employer than annoying potential customers over the 
                 phone. I'm originally from Raleigh, North Carolina, and graduated from UNC 
                 Chapel Hill with a double major in Spanish and Global Studies as well as a Business 
                 Essentials certification from UNC's Kenan-Flagler Business School.
            </p>

            <p>Outside of work, chances are you'll find me outside somewhere. Whether 
                it's visiting a National Park, going for a hike in the hills west of 
                Austin, or just working on the garden in my backyard, I always make an 
                effort to get out in the sun for a little bit each day. If I'm not in the great 
                outdoors, I'm probably glued to the TV watching UNC Basketball 
                take a run at another national title or watching the Carolina Hurricanes 
                take a run at another high draft pick.
            </p>
